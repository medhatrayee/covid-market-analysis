This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indian equity market volatility, with a specific focus on the NIFTY 50 index and sectoral dynamics in NIFTY Pharma.
The project addresses the following questions:

Did equity market volatility spike before or after domestic COVID-19 case escalation?

Was volatility structurally linked to epidemiological trends?

Did the Pharma sector demonstrate relative outperformance during the crisis?

How did volatility behavior differ across pandemic phases?
